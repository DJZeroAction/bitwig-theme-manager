Bitwig meets Cubase Theme - aka Cubasewig 😄
Inspired by Cubase 13s Interface. Download it here: https://github.com/Sternenherz/Themes
This Theme was made by color-picking most of the Cubase 13 interface Elements, then editing Bitwigs theme via berikais awesome Editor.

I made two versions of this theme. The main version folder is called "Cubase 13", the alternative version "Cubase 13 greyblue".
In the alternative Version, the PLAY Transport Button, Mute Buttons, Track-Volume-Faders, and other Button Elements are colored in grey-blue for better visible distinction between elements.
If you want them in a more neutral white, choose the "Cubase 13" Theme. Above mentioned elements are the only differences between the themes.

Favorite Darkmode Settings for me: Bitwig -> User Interface -> Contrast -> Midtones: 35, Black Level 35, Grid Lines 80.

If you want the default Cubase Color Palette for coloring Clips, you can load "Sternenherz Cubase Colors.png" [which you find in the "Cubase 13 Color Palette" folder on Github] inside of Bitwig.

I also created a new Bitwig Desktop Icon just for fun, representing the new artstyle, feel free to download that from the "Cubase 13 Desktop Icon for Bitwig" Folder.

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE PIANO ROLL NOTE HIGHLIGHTING: Since Cubase does not have any kind of visual background-light-highlighting, when selecting notes, and no distracting vertical lines left and right from selected notes, i deleted this visual mess out of the Bitwig Theme. If you want it back, you have to adjust the Theme yourself, sorry! So go to https://bitwig.berikai.dev/, load my theme, click on 'Arranger', type "inactive" into the search bar, and look at the parameter to change called: "Time Selection Inactive Fill" - simply make it less transparent to make it visible again. The vertical lines should be "Time Selection Inactive Stroke". If you're new to theming, visit ⁠theming !

Have fun! 🙂

reimagined dark/elegant variant of the original one, 50/50/ 30?, with the still necessary compromise between the piano roll and the arranger, these are the default meters, in case if anyone misses them

    "Meter Hitech": "#23d1d4",

    "Meter Yellow": "#ffde42",
    "Meter Muted": "#979797",
    "Meter Normal": "#8ccb2a",

scrollbars are the ... try
"Medium Light Text": "#a0a0a0" if you find it obtrusive, price is less readability (it gonna change zillions other things too)

was curious about how much the design could be flattened and whether the devices could be made as sleek as in Cubase, to tasty black ones, yummie 😋, It definitely has a pretty interesting vibe with the flat arranger together the real hardware like devices  (the base was the dark one, second from the top)

This is my take of what an official Dark theme could be.

New theme: Purplwig+ (idk what to call it)

Main colour is purple(#D58EFF) which replaces the Orange colour that you all seem to really love.
There is also a lot of lime green used, mainly for the modulation envelopes and stuff.
Everything else is close to the default theme , with very minor adjustments to make it appear slightly more uniform.
Hope you enjoy it.  If you end up using it and have any feedback or improvements please feel free to DM me : )


If you would like to use the icons that I have for the native devices you can obtain them from my previous post:

Inspired by Studio One dark mode... but then kinda went in another direction. Best settings imho are very dark ones (25/25 or less).
As a bonus I also made a Minimeters skin matching the meters of the theme (view top of the screenshot).

Explore this conversation and more from the Bitwig community
Bitwig community on Reddit: nClearMusic commented "I'll explain how I got this running on macOS: First, I installed HomeBrew. This can be done in the terminal with the command: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" Or by installing it through a pkg ( https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/tag/4.3.5 ). Then, I installed JRE. For this, I ran this in Terminal: brew install openjdk Next, I created a symbolic link with command: sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk. After that, I added Java to the Path: echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc source ~/.zshrc Now, it can be launched. Since I have " bitwig-theme-editor-1.3.0.jar " and the themes on my desktop, I launched it like this: java -jar ~/Desktop/bitwig-theme-editor-1.3.0.jar /Applications/Bitwig\ Studio.app/Contents/Java/bitwig.jar apply ~/Desktop/themes/nctheme.json But first, I recommend saving the current theme: java -jar ~/Desktop/bitwig-theme-editor-1.3.0.jar /Applications/Bitwig\ Studio.app/Contents/Java/bitwig.jar export ~/Desktop/themes/backup-current.json P.S. I'm not a super expert in this, but in my case, it worked. P.P.S. If you hear the "SOS im cracked" melody, just restart Bitwig ;) Visual Editor in progress — https://nclear.pro/bitwig-theme-editor.mp4"

That would look great as a wallpaper for the arranger view as well

Not sure I’d want that, I think in FL Studio it’s a bit too much tbh

Greenwig+ (idk what else to call it )

I see lots of themes here, but I thought Bitwig didn't have support for theming? How does it work and is there documentation for creating and installing themes?
dsnvs — 12/31/25, 1:46 PM
We do theming discussions over at ⁠theming (this channel is for showcasing only), but here's how to get started: ⁠theming⁠
